Hi! My name is Max Mustermann and I recently finished a 10-month Java programming course at [everyone codes](https://everyonecodes.io/). In order to practice our newly-gained skills in Java and Spring Boot, we had 6 weeks to work on a small project of our choice. As an avid language learner, I decided to write a small clone of Anki, a program that allows you to create and review flashcards.
